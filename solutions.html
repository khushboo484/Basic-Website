<h1 align="center"> SOME SOLUTIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
<div class="row"><div align="left">
<img src="Images\4.jpg"></div> <div><p align="right">
There is no single solution to global warming, which is primarily a problem of too much heat-trapping carbon dioxide (CO2),
 methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. (Learn more about the causes of global warming.) The technologies and approaches 
outlined below are all needed to bring down the emissions of these gases by at least 80 percent by mid-century. </p></div>
To promote global warming solutions, Environment America, our network of 29 state affiliates, and members and activists 
in all 50 states are running these projects and campaigns:

Fossil Fuel Free: Even as global warming accelerates, the major oil, gas and coal companies are sticking to business as usual.
 Fortunately, a growing number of investors understand that the industrys business model is incompatible with what scientists
 are telling us we must do to slow global warming. That is why we are supporting the fossil fuel divestment movement.

</p>
<h3> TROPICAL RAINFOREST:</h3>
<p> To slow global warming, we must protect the worlds tropical forests. We are doing our part by urging companies to commit
 to stop cutting them down a commitment known as zero-deforestation. We are currently focusing on the beef and soybean supply chain.</p>

<h3>CLEAN CAR COMMUNITIES </h3>
<p>We also need to change what we drive. We are calling for all new cars and trucks to be electric by 2035.
 We know our leaders in Washington, D.C., are going the wrong way on this issue, so our Clean Car Communities campaign is 
urging local and state officials to point the way forward.<br><br>On mitigation, the Bank has initiated work on a low carbon growth
 strategy and is supporting initiatives to maximize access to renewable energy and promote energy efficiency, while meeting economic
 objectives and bringing modern energy to the 400 million who still lack access to electricity.
<br><br>
With a dedicated strategy, India can develop a portfolio of strategic climate investments and tap into the numerous financial 
instruments available to transition the economy to more resilient growth and a low carbon path.  The World Bank stands ready to 
assist India in this endeavor.
<h3>REGIONAL CLIMATE ACTION</h3>
<p>Regional Climate Action: We also must reduce and ultimately eliminate carbon pollution from power plants. Especially given the 
absence of leadership from Washington, D.C., the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative might be the most important climate program you 
have never heard of.
