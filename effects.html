<h1>Effects of climate change</h1>
<p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk,
 ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.

Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, 
accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.</p>
<img src="Images\56.jpeg" style="height:50%;width:50%;"><br><br><h3>Temperatures Will Continue to Rise
 </h3>
<p>Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.</p>
<br> <br>
<h3> Frost-free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen
 </h3>
<p>The length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen.</p>
<h3> Changes in Precipitation Patterns</h3>
<p>Average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century.</p>
  <h3>Arctic Likely to Become Ice-Free</h3>
<p>The Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century.</p>
