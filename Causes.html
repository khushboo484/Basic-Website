<ul><h1 align="center"> CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE </h1></ul>
<h4> Climate change is threat to society.The main cause is human itself.Humans have themselves created this environmental change. </h4>
<img src="Images\19.jpg"><br>
<p> Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect of climate
 change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.
 The terms global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably. However, speaking more accurately, globa
l warming denotes the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation, but 
climate change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation. While there have been 
prehistoric periods of global warming, many observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over 
decades to millennia.

</p>
<br>
<h3>SOME OF THE CAUSES ARE LISTED BELOW:</h3><br>
<h2>1. Burning fossil fuels</h2>
When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas to create electricity or power our cars, we release CO2 pollution into the atmosphere.

Australians are big producers of CO2 pollution compared to the rest of the world. Our level of CO2 pollution per person is nearly double the average of other developed nations and more than four times the world average.

Electricity generation is the main cause of carbon pollution in Australia as 73% of our electricity comes from burning coal and 13% from burning gas. The remaining 14% comes from renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar and wind, which do not emit carbon.
<br>
<h2>2. Deforestation & Tree-Clearing</h2>
Plants and trees play an important role in regulating the climate because they absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release
 oxygen back into it. Forests and bushland act as carbon sinks and are a valuable means of keeping global warming to 1.5degreeC.

<br>
<h2>3. Agriculture & Farming</h2>
Animals, particularly livestock like sheep and cattle, produce methane, a greenhouse gas. When livestock are grazed at a large scale, as in Australia, the amount of methane produced is a big contributor to global warming.

Some fertilisers that farmers use also release nitrous oxide, which is another greenhouse gas.

Australian farming contributes 16% of our total greenhouse gas emissions.
